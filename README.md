# Javascript 2 Noroff Course assignment adding functionality for a SoMe-app

## Goal
To apply knowledge of JavaScript techniques to implement the front-end functionality for a social media application.

## Brief
You have been tasked with producing a new JavaScript front-end client for an existing social media platform. The client application must be attractive and responsive, but you have an otherwise blank slate in terms of theme design language.

Using the provided API and API documentation, create a functioning user interface that allows for viewing, posting, editing and deleting social media content.

Social API routes require authorisation via JWT (JSON Web Tokens). You will need to register an account and login to access your token.

To complete the required features, you will also need to make use of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods.

Using localStorage is highly recommended, especially for storing JWT tokens.

A finished project fulfils the requirements below with an easy to use and error-free user interface.

## Required features
The following user stories are required for a passing submission:

User with @noroff.no or @stud.noroff.no email can register profile
Registered user can login
User can view a post content feed
User can filter the post content feed
User can search the post content feed
User can view a post content item by ID
User can create a post content item
User can update a post content item
User can delete a post content item

## Process
1. Create or select one repository to use throughout this project.
2. Create a js2 branch from the default master or main branch.
3. You may use either Trello or GitHub Projects to manage your development tasks. If you are using Trello, please make sure that your board is public and that a link is provided in your readme.md file. Make sure to detail tasks accurately and divide them evenly if working a group.

4. Review the API Guide and API Documentation.
5. Plan your approach, desired features and work strategy.
6. Implement the required features as per your work plan.

Note: All PRs should be made to js2, not to the default branch. For example, branch search-functionality should be created from, and merged into, branch js2.

7. Submit a link to your repository at the correct branch on the Moodle forum for peer review.
8. Review 2 of your peers projects. (4 per team)

9. Open a Pull Request from js2 into the default branch. Contact a teacher on Discord for their feedback. If there is a particular area of concern, please ensure to pass this on with your request. Add this teacher as a reviewer on your PR. Please make sure to plan for this review prior to your deadline.
10. Implement the feedback gathered from your review, but leave the PR open.
11. Deliver the link to this PR in Moodle. A passing submission will be approved and merged by the reviewer. This is a direct analogue of the professional review process.

## Restrictions
Required functionality must be implemented in original, pure JavaScript.
A CSS Framework may be used to build the application UI.
A .gitignore file must be provided including node_modules. This folder must be untracked.
Content posted on the API is public and associated with your identity. Be appropriate and respectful.
